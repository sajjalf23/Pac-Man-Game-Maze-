PAC_MAN_GAME (MAZE)

This is a 2D displayed Python-based implementation of the classic Pac-Man game. The game features a grid layout where Pac-Man collects dots, avoids ghosts, and gains temporary power-ups to eat ghosts. The goal is to collect all the dots while avoiding losing all lives.

FEATURES

- Power-Ups: Pac-Man can temporarily eat ghosts after consuming power-ups.

- Score Tracking: Keep track of your progress with a scoring system.

- Lives System: Pac-Man starts with 3 lives and loses one upon collision with a ghost (unless powered up).

- Interactive Gameplay: Use directional inputs (up, down, left, right) to navigate the maze.

Version 2 : contains 2D display and pygame technology is used.
